This project demonstrates real-time object detection using OpenCV and Python. The script captures live video, detects objects of a specified color (yellow in this case), and highlights them with a bounding box.

Features

Uses OpenCV to capture live video from the webcam.

Converts the frame to HSV color space for accurate color detection.

Applies a mask to isolate objects of a specific color.

Draws bounding boxes around detected objects.

Runs in real-time and stops on pressing 'q'.

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x

OpenCV

NumPy

PIL (Pillow)
